i tried a lot to get in to git
i tried for git add .
it showed warning as it accepts LF will be replaced by CRLF in Somefile.
lf:line feed
crlf:carriage line feed
2.git commit asked me for username and email
as it is git config --global user.name "shankar"
git config --global user.eamil "umashankar.sangu6@gmail.com"
3.while i tried for git push it asked me to login in git
so i logged in with my credentials
so at last i am able gone through the git
